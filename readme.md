This i a simple responsive tester with iframes with predefined with and heights.

Just enter the url in the textbox and click Go! to load the page.

The iframe solution was maybe not optional since some site's blocks the iframe
with the X-Frame-Options=SAMEORIGIN header. So if you want to use this to test
your site to different screen sizes your site needs to be able to run in an iframe.
